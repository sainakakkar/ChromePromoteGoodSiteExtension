# Teen sites blocker for 2023 

### installing locally:

Fellow Teens, this is Saina Kakkar, have you ever got caught up in mindlessly selecting a recommended video in YouTube instead of intentionally watching the video you were looking for.

YouTube is a great resource for students. I love some of the professor playlist so never like to block it, but some times get hooked into eye catching videos put on my feed, the new YouTube shorts, and yeah those adult games content getting advertised/notified.

If you are like me, then here is my new extension where I would like to smarty divert you to good content and silently divert you away from all new useless recommendation that YouTube makes. Follow the steps:

1. save folder
2. go to `chrome://extensions`
3. toggle `Developer mode`
4. click `Load unpacked`
5. upload folder
6. extension should now be enabled!
